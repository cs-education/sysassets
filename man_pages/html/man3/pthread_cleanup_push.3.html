<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*</B><I>routine</I><B>)(void *),</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

These functions manipulate the calling thread's stack of
thread-cancellation clean-up handlers.
A clean-up handler is a function that is automatically executed
when a thread is canceled (or in various other circumstances
described below);
it might, for example, unlock a mutex so that
it becomes available to other threads in the process.
<P>
The
<B>pthread_cleanup_push</B>()

function pushes
<I>routine</I>

onto the top of the stack of clean-up handlers.
When
<I>routine</I>

is later invoked, it will be given
<I>arg</I>

as its argument.
<P>
The
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

function removes the routine at the top of the stack of clean-up handlers,
and optionally executes it if
<I>execute</I>

is nonzero.
<P>
A cancellation clean-up handler is popped from the stack
and executed in the following circumstances:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
When a thread is canceled,
all of the stacked clean-up handlers are popped and executed in
the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto the stack.
<DT>2.<DD>
When a thread terminates by calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/pthread_exit.3.html">pthread_exit</A></B>(3),

all clean-up handlers are executed as described in the preceding point.
(Clean-up handlers are
<I>not</I>

called if the thread terminates by
performing a
<I>return</I>

from the thread start function.)
<DT>3.<DD>
When a thread calls
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

with a nonzero
<I>execute</I>

argument, the top-most clean-up handler is popped and executed.
</DL>
<P>

POSIX.1 permits
<B>pthread_cleanup_push</B>()

and
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

to be implemented as macros that expand to text
containing '<B>{</B>' and '<B>}</B>', respectively.
For this reason, the caller must ensure that calls to these
functions are paired within the same function,
and at the same lexical nesting level.
(In other words, a clean-up handler is established only
during the execution of a specified section of code.)
<P>
Calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/longjmp.3.html">longjmp</A></B>(3)

(<B><A HREF="../man3/siglongjmp.3.html">siglongjmp</A></B>(3))

produces undefined results if any call has been made to
<B>pthread_cleanup_push</B>()

or
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

without the matching call of the pair since the jump buffer
was filled by
<B><A HREF="../man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp</A></B>(3)

(<B><A HREF="../man3/sigsetjmp.3.html">sigsetjmp</A></B>(3)).

Likewise, calling
<B><A HREF="../man3/longjmp.3.html">longjmp</A></B>(3)

(<B><A HREF="../man3/siglongjmp.3.html">siglongjmp</A></B>(3))

from inside a clean-up handler produces undefined results
unless the jump buffer was also filled by
<B><A HREF="../man3/setjmp.3.html">setjmp</A></B>(3)

(<B><A HREF="../man3/sigsetjmp.3.html">sigsetjmp</A></B>(3))

inside the handler.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

These functions do not return a value.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

There are no errors.


<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

POSIX.1-2001.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

On Linux, the
<B>pthread_cleanup_push</B>()

and
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

functions
<I>are</I>

implemented as macros that expand to text
containing '<B>{</B>' and '<B>}</B>', respectively.
This means that variables declared within the scope of
paired calls to these functions will be visible within only that scope.
<P>
POSIX.1

says that the effect of using
<I>return</I>,

<I>break</I>,

<I>continue</I>,

or
<I>goto</I>

to prematurely leave a block bracketed
<B>pthread_cleanup_push</B>()

and
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

is undefined.
Portable applications should avoid doing this.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

The program below provides a simple example of the use of the functions
described in this page.
The program creates a thread that executes a loop bracketed by
<B>pthread_cleanup_push</B>()

and
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>().

This loop increments a global variable,
<I>cnt</I>,

once each second.
Depending on what command-line arguments are supplied,
the main thread sends the other thread a cancellation request,
or sets a global variable that causes the other thread
to exit its loop and terminate normally (by doing a
<I>return</I>).

<P>
In the following shell session,
the main thread sends a cancellation request to the other thread:
<P>

<PRE>
$ <B>./a.out</B>
New thread started
cnt = 0
cnt = 1
Canceling thread
Called clean-up handler
Thread was canceled; cnt = 0
</PRE>


<P>
From the above, we see that the thread was canceled,
and that the cancellation clean-up handler was called
and it reset the value of the global variable
<I>cnt</I>

to 0.
<P>
In the next run, the main program sets a
global variable that causes other thread to terminate normally:
<P>

<PRE>
$ <B>./a.out x</B>
New thread started
cnt = 0
cnt = 1
Thread terminated normally; cnt = 2
</PRE>


<P>
From the above, we see that the clean-up handler was not executed (because
<I>cleanup_pop_arg</I>

was 0), and therefore the value of
<I>cnt</I>

was not reset.
<P>
In the next run, the main program sets a global variable that
causes the other thread to terminate normally,
and supplies a nonzero value for
<I>cleanup_pop_arg</I>:

<P>

<PRE>
$ <B>./a.out x 1</B>
New thread started
cnt = 0
cnt = 1
Called clean-up handler
Thread terminated normally; cnt = 0
</PRE>


<P>
In the above, we see that although the thread was not canceled,
the clean-up handler was executed, because the argument given to
<B>pthread_cleanup_pop</B>()

was nonzero.
